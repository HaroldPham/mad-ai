      <h2>What is MaD AI?</h2>
      <p>What is MaD AI? It's easiest to answer that with an equation:
      </p>
      <p>Misinformation + Disinformation + AI = MaD AI </p>
      <p>So now let us provide the proof of the theorem: when misinformation and disinformation are combined to create a
        medium of false information, AI will come and act as a catalyst for this false information carrying it across
        the lands looking for vengeance, which is why we call it MaD AI.

      <h2>Why Do We Look at MaD AI?
      </h2>
      <p>MaD is everywhere in the world. You might notice MaD spread by your friends and family. You might notice MaD
        spread by people around you in public. But how do you suppose MaD spreads by AI? The world in 2023 doesn't just
        comprise of our physical environment, but it includes the digital world as well. The way we interact with others
        on the internet is similar to how we interact with others in the physical world, yet, there are many more unique
        ways to spread this information and turn it into a different kind of MaD than we expect to see in the physical
        world.
      </p>
      <p>With the introduction of ChatGPT , we now have a new way of understanding information, alongside a new way to
        spread MaD in the world. With ChatGPT most people would only consider looking at using it to one's advantage
        since it comes as easily as asking it a question and receiving a response. But what if there was nuance to that
        response? How would that affect the way you learn information, and how does that lead to the spread of MaD?
      </p>
      <p>In this website, we hope to pry at your mind and help you start thinking about the consequences, whether
        positive or negative, of ChatGP. We will show you a glimpse how ChatGPT may affect your life directly, or maybe
        how it might affect your life indirectly through the infrastructures around you.
