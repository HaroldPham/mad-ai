          <h2>Disinformation - ChatGPT</h2>
          <p>Even though OpenAI's policy says that its technology can't be used to promote dishonesty, trick or
            manipulate users, or to try to change politics, as shown above, users can easily spread false information
            with ChatGPT by using certain cue words. It is difficult to combat disinformation that is manufactured
            artificially. For more conspiracy theorists and disinformation distributors, ChatGPT's generation technology
            can make disinformation production less expensive and easier to do. ChatGPT can quickly generate
            disinformation that appears logical and believable, and unlike other chatbots, it can imitate a different
            tone of voice and writing style to avoid the need for bots to be identified. This could result in an
            abundance of social networking bots. This may increase the spread of fake content on social media platforms,
            and can make it easier to deceive viewers. In the figure above, ChatGPT does a good job of generating false
            information, despite being given an absurdly misleading prompt to generate. If someone can use ChatGPT to
            generate fake information that is more deceptive, this will make it more difficult to detect and identify.
            When technology can produce content that is sufficiently realistic, the cost of counterfeiting will be
            drastically reduced, and the spread of disinformation will become uncontrollable if it is not restricted by
            technical and legal means.

          <h2>Misinformation - ChatGPT</h2>
          <p>As seen in the images above, there are numerous error messages generated by ChatGPT. Despite the fact that
            some of these error messages are extremely obvious, ChatGPT responds in a professional-sounding affirmative
            manner. If the user's question is more complex, ChatGPT provides a large number of detailed and correct
            answers; however, errors and misinformation are concealed within a large number of correct answers, making
            it difficult to distinguish what is false, and negatively impacting the user's experience and usage.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Based on our testing and research, the errors and misinformation in ChatGPT's answers are extremely random, as
        it sometimes generates correct or incorrect answers to the same question, making it more challenging to identify
        which is false (Thompson, 2023). Therefore, when utilizing ChatGPT, users should be cautious not to endorse or
        implement ChatGPT's answers without verification, as this could result in the spread of misinformation.
